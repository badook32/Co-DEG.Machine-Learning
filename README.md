# Co-DEG & Machine Learning-Based Multi-Omics Analysis

This repository contains R scripts for integrated analysis of bulk microarray and single-cell RNA-seq data, focused on co-differentially expressed genes (Co-DEGs). The workflow includes functional interpretation (GO/KEGG), network analysis, GSVA, TF activity estimation, and predictive modeling using machine learning techniques.

## üîß Input Data

* **scRNA-seq Dataset**: GSE159677
* **Microarray Dataset**: GSE100927
* **Bulk Microarray DEG**: `DEG1_Disease_High_vs_Low.csv`, etc. (4 files total)
* **scRNA-seq DEG**: `scRNA_DEG1_*.csv`, etc. (4 files total)
* **Gene Expression Matrix**: `GSE100927_gene_mapped_expression.csv`

## üß¨ Co-DEG Comparison Definitions

Co-DEGs were identified by intersecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from microarray and single-cell RNA-seq analyses under the following conditions:

* **CoDEG1**: OASL High vs Low in **Disease** samples
* **CoDEG2**: OASL High vs Low in **NonDisease** samples
* **CoDEG3**: **Disease vs NonDisease** among **OASL High** samples
* **CoDEG4**: **Disease vs NonDisease** among **OASL Low** samples

## üìÅ Workflow Overview

### 1. Co-DEG Identification

* Extract genes consistently differentially expressed in both bulk and scRNA-seq data
* Apply thresholds: |FC| > 1 and adjusted p < 0.05
* Annotate direction: UpUp, DownDown, Discordant

### 2. Functional Enrichment

* Perform GO and KEGG analysis using `clusterProfiler`
* Use only UpUp and DownDown genes
* Visualizations include barplots and radar charts

### 3. GSVA (Gene Set Variation Analysis)

* Based on MSigDB hallmark gene sets
* Split samples into OASL High vs Low expression groups
* Generate heatmaps, boxplots, and bar charts of pathway activities

### 4. Transcription Factor Activity

* Estimate TF activity using VIPER and dorothea regulons
* Visualize results via heatmaps and barplots

### 5. Machine Learning Models

* Apply LASSO, Random Forest, and SVM-RFE
* Select genes based on Co-DEG results
* Identify overlapping genes across models and evaluate prediction performance via ROC curves

### 6. ROC Analysis

* Evaluate predictive power of selected genes and model consensus genes
* Visualize ROC curves and AUC-based rankings

### 7. PPI Network Analysis

* Extract key GO-BP terms and build correlation-based pseudo PPI networks
* Highlight hub genes based on degree centrality
